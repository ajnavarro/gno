# IBC Protocol

The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allows independent blockchains to directly communicate and trade assets.

- The Inter‐Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), an open‐source protocol for relaying messages between independently distributed ledgers, was created to connect independent blockchains.
- IBC allows heterogeneous chains to trustlessly communicate with each other and exchange value, particularly tokens, which makes them interoperable.
- A key feature of IBC is that the connected blockchains do not need to communicate with each other directly. Instead, they can send packets of information via dedicated channels using smart contracts to connect to the chains.
- The Tendermint‐based decentralized exchange [Osmosis](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/protocol-guides/guide-to-osmosis) allows token holders to directly benefit from what IBC offers by enabling seamless swaps of tokens from different chains.
