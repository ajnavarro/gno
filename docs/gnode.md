Gnodes are interconnected [DAOs](./daos.md) for scaling and specialized communities. They enable secure collaboration and seamless integration, facilitating transparent ecosystem management at scale.

- second layer: relationships between entities, burn rate, payments (the "basic income" layer)
- third layer: conflicts of interest, ownership stakes (privacy-preserving)
