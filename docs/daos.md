# DAOs
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are represented as a group of [Realm](./realm.md)s or/and [package](.)s that can manage decisions using the blockchain. We have several DAOs that will be in charge of:

- [OP Values prize DAO](.): It will define the prize per VM Op.
- [Evaluation DAO](evaluation-dao.md): It will be in charge of making [Proof of Contribution](.) works.
